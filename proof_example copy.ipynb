Or it might have failure modes that are not salient to us (adversarial examples). We could also steer a model towards a desired behaviour, if I understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these issues could be resolved, if the models were transparent to us (though this is not the only approach). So an important question to raise here is: \n",
    "What do we mean when we talk of \"a mechanistic understanding\" of a model? When is a model transparent to us?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a difficult question! Let's say you study a model and reverse engineered parts of it, say a circuit. How can you be sure that the circuit you found actually does the thing you are claiming it is? Let's look at the specific example of autoencoders. This is a quote from [*Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning*](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Usually in machine learning we can quite easily tell if a method is working by looking at an easily-measured quantity like the test loss. We spent quite some time searching for an equivalent metric to guide our efforts here, and unfortunately have yet to find anything satisfactory.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">We began by looking for an information-based metric, so that we could say in some sense that the best factorization is the one that minimizes the total information of the autoencoder and the data. Unfortunately, this total information did not generally correlate with subjective feature interpretability or activation sparsity.[...]\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Thus we ended up using a combination of several additional metrics to guide our investigations[...]\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Interpreting or measuring some of these signals can be difficult, though. For instance, at various points we thought we saw features which at first didn’t make any sense, but with deeper inspection we could understand.\n",

    "Having quantative methods would not only make mechanistic interpretability research more rigorous. If we want to scale up methods to huge models, we will need to automate parts of the process and we won't be able to have a human in the loop at every crucial point. A lack of quantative benchmarks makes this task seem almost impossible. To spoiler the punchline: Compact proofs provide such a quantative benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the details, let's nail down two things that we want to quantify. The following two points are taken from the [Compact proofs blog post](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/bRsKimQcPTX3tNNJZ/compact-proofs-of-model-performance-via-mechanistic#Introduction), see also this [comment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LNA8mubrByG7SFacm/against-almost-every-theory-of-impact-of-interpretability-1?commentId=7fNRMke9Gc4QghYyf) by Ryan Greenblatt.\n",

    ">2. Compression: Explanations compress the particular behavior of interest. Not just so that it fits in our heads, but also so that it generalizes well and is feasible to find and check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the second points implies that the explanation, say the circuit that we discovered, should be more **compact** and therefore more understandable for us humans: The weights of a model are a perfectly faithful explanation of its behaviour, but this explanation is meaningless and not helpful for us."
